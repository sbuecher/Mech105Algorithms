*** Linearizing Non-Linear Functions

This MATLAB script takes data set, scales it by log10 or natural log, plots the data,  and fits
a linear regression line to it

This could be used to take a exponential growth function, such as bacteria growth, and create a linear
regression line for it to predict future growth
