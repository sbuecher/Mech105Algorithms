*** MATLAB Simpson method code

This code contains a MATLAB function that integrates a table of values using Simpson's method

This could be used to find the displacement of an object when given a table of velocity and time 

Numerical evaluation of integral by Simpson's 1/3 Rule
 Inputs
   x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
   y = the vector of function values with respect to x
 Outputs
   I = the numerical integral calculated
