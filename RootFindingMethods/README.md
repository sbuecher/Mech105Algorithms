*** Root Finding Methods

This folder contains the MATLAB code for methods used to find the roots of functions and tables. The
methods used are

1. Bisection Method
2. False Position Method
3. Newton's Method
4. Secant Method
5. Modified Secant Method

These could be used to solve a complicated equation that would take an extensive amount of time, such as
a skydiver's velocity in free fall accounting for air resistance, by setting it equal to zero and solving
for a specific value
